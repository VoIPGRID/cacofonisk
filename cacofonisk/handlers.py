    The simple way to use this method is to pass your own Reporter to it.
    The Reporter receives simple, high level hooks about a call. See
    BaseReporter for more information about these hooks.

    Alternatively, you can implement your own, more low-level events by
    extending EventHandler and overriding one or more of the following methods:
    - on_state_change
    - on_a_dial

    - on_bridge_enter
    - on_attended_transfer
    - on_blind_transfer
    - on_blonde_transfer
